# Advent of Code 2024

## Summary

to be added later

## Procedure

Each day I followed the following three steps:

1. Read and solve part 1.
1. Read and solve part 2
   (trying to reuse as much of part 1 as possible).
1. (Optional) Refactor and compare with other solutions (via Discord)
   to see what else could be improved.

I tried to consider performance in the initial implementation
and that mostly held true,
avoiding brute-force solutions where possible
and achieving competitive benchmark results for the most part.
There are of course exceptions to this.
