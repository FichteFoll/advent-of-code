# FichteFoll's Advent of Code

These are just my quick and dirty solutions to the
[Advent of Code][] Advent calendar
for everyone to see, frown and laugh at.

Code is split into folders by year and day
with my input included for better reproduction.

For **2017**, my goals were to use **Rust**,
which I had barely used until that point,
and to not use any external crates.
I did not complete all puzzles,
so you'll only see those that I completed.
Unstable and experimental features were allowed.

For **2018**, I will *again* use **Rust**
because I like the language a lot
but don't have any real uses for it
considering my day-to-day language is Python.
I'm unsure whether I'll allow external crates this time,
but unstable is definitely allowed.
